# GUVI Blog Project

This is a blog project built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that showcases a collection of technical articles related to various fields like Full Stack Development, Data Science, Cyber Security, and Career. The blog displays cards for each article with images, titles, descriptions, and publication dates. It includes a responsive design suitable for both desktop and mobile views.

## Features

- **Dynamic Routing**: Uses React Router for navigation between different categories.
- **Data Sorting**: Articles are sorted by date (latest first).
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive and optimized for mobile view.
- **Categories**: Articles are filtered by categories such as:
  - Full Stack Development
  - Data Science
  - Cyber Security
  - Career
- **Bootstrap Integration**: The design is styled using Bootstrap for quick and responsive layouts.
